Hi, my name is Patrick Skiba and I'm a software developer living in Hartford, CT. 

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/patrickskiba), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/skibap/), or you can write me an email at [pskiba@posteo.net](mailto:pskiba@posteo.net).

## Experience

While I do have my preferences, I don't label myself as an "insert framework here" developer. 

My experience ranges from:
- Creating multiple React/Node web apps and successfully deploying them to production to tens of thousands of users
- Maintaining legacy VB Dotnet APIs that few dare to touch
- Working on the first iOS app in my department which has recieved many accolades for its increase in employee efficiency and cost-saving benefits


## My Hobbies and Interests

#### Technology Related:
- Vim, paricularly [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), is my editor of choice at home. It is an editor so powerful that you can learn something new each day and still have so much more to learn.
- I keep many notes to stay organized, my primary tool for this is [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org/). Due to its lack of portability, I maintain a companion app called [Web-org](https://github.com/Patrickskiba/weborg) that I hope will one day surpass similar projects currently available.
- I enjoy learning about Unix and how to use standard Unix utilities such as awk, sed, and grep. As a Linux and Mac user, being familar with your system and the software that comes with it is very useful.

#### Non-Technology Related:
- I am a foodie and will take several trips down to New York City with my girlfriend for some culinary adventures. 
- In recent years I've gained an appreciation for Connecticut's craft brewery scene. Living in Hartford, I have access to great local gems such as [Hanging Hills](http://www.hanginghillsbrewery.com/) and [Hog River](https://www.hogriverbrewing.com/).
- Though I don't do this as often as I would like, I enjoy a day of rock climbing at the local rock climbing gym. 
- Cats, I love cats. This is my cat, Pete:
